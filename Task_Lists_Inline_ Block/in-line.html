<p>block elements are used to create larger divisions or sections of a webpage. Unlike inline elements, block elements take up the full width of their parent container and create a line break before and after the element. They are often used to create structural elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Take up the full width of their parent container by default.</li>
        <li>Take up the height of their content by default, but can be set to a fixed or percentage height.</li>
        <li>All types of margins and padding can be applied to them.</li>
    </ul>

 <p>Inline elements are called so because they are typically placed inside other HTML elements, such as paragraphs or headings. Unlike block-level elements, which start on a new line and take up the entire width of their parent container, inline elements only take up as much space as necessary to display their content.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take up only as much width as necessary to display their content.</li>
        <li>Take up only as much height as necessary to display their content.</li>
        <li>Do not cause line breaks.</li>

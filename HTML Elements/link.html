    <h2>1-HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundational technologies for creating web pages. HTML provides the structure,
        while CSS defines the style and layout.
        HTML is used along with CSS and Javascript to design web pages.</h2>

    <h4>2-HTML and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> are both essential tools for building websites,

        <u> while CSS provides its presentation and layout.</u> <br>While they are often used together, 
        <u> itâ€™s important to understand the differences between these two languages to create effective and visually appealing websites.</u></h4>
